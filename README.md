# dog-breed-identification
This project builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.
## 1. Problem
> Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog
## 2. Data
> As Data we are using Kaggle's Dog breed identification. You can find it here
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification
## 3. Evaluation
>The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image
## 4. Features
> Some information about the data:
* We are dealing with images (Unstructured Data), so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.
* There are 120 breeds of Dogs, which means it has  120 different classes.
* There are around 10k+ test images and 10k+ train images
